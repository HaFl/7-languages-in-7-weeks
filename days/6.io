/* Good to know
- the special thing about operators (which are syntactic sugar for functions or
    in the case of Io messages) is that you don't need to write 5 /(4) but
    instead can write 5 / 4
- spacing is weird in Io as you basically could write everything on one line
    (due to everything being a message). However, the use of ";" is possible
